Ga reference: https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga/blob/master/ga.js

MOVE ALL PRIVATE VARIABLES TO PUBLIC. PRIVATE VARIABLES DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST IN JS.

Complete sections marked with "// TODO".

Make a "Tap to allow audio." button appear if AudioContext is muted.

Look at plugins.js to see what you want to implement
- progress bar?
- particles?

Look through other frameworks for features that should be implemented.

Make an ABSOLUTE MINIMUM version (u.js)

After finishing the code:
1) Go through all the ga.js code again to make sure you didn't miss anything on accident.
2) Go through all the umbra.js code to make sure there isn't anything dumb in it.
3) Go through Ga bug reports to see if there's anything that can be improved.
4) Write documentation.
5) Uglify to umbra.min.js (for version 1. Use Umbra Builder after that).

Umbra Builder:
- Include only necessary parts of the code from a UI.
- Mark code with "// UMBRATAGSTART/UMBRATAGEND <TAG(s, separated by space)>" to help write a builder with only one source file.
- Tags should be treated as ANDs if declared on separate lines, and ORs if declared on the same line.
- Mark code with "// UMBRATAGDESC <Description>" to add descriptions to tags, to be displayed in Umbra Builder. Probably put at the top.
- Make tag "REQUIRED" non-optional.
- Get newest umbra.js from online with builder, so it can be a one-file program.
- Show un-uglified byte count (WITHOUT COMMENTS) for each tag.
- Probably write in Java Swing.
- Automatically uglify when done.

Documentation:
- Video documentation.
- Make it like the documentation for Discord.js.
- Include required Umbra Builder tag in article.
