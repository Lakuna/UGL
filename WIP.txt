Lines marked with "// TODO"

After finishing the code:
1) Go through all the ga.js code again to make sure you didn't miss anything on accident.
2) Go through all the umbra.js code to make sure there isn't anything dumb in it.
3) Go through Ga bug reports to see if there's anything that can be improved.
4) Write documentation.
5) Uglify to umbra.min.js
