Comparisons
-----------

Ga
~~~
Umbra was preceeded by Ga (https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga). All code in Umbra is original, but most feature ideas were taken directly from Ga.
That being said, Umbra boasts many advantages over Ga:

- Every feature that Ga has (minus drag-and-drop), and several more.
- Significantly faster.
- Can be built to match the user's needs, reducing file size.
- Even a full installation is less than half of the size of Ga without any plugins.
- Native support for audio.
- Object-oriented.
- Nice documententation.
- Has been updated within the last half decade.

Kontra
~~~~~~
Umbra is also comparable to the significantly more popular Kontra.js (https://straker.github.io/kontra/).

- More features at a smaller size.
- Features that exist in Kontra and not Umbra are easy to implement in each project and don't belong in a framework.
