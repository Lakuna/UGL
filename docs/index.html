		<h1>Umbra Framework</h1>
		<hr/>

		<p><b>Umbra</b> is an HTML5 game framework created for the <a href='https://js13kgames.com/'>JS13KGames Game Jam</a>, in which the total size of your submission is limited to only 13KB. Umbra is ultra-lightweight, with a specialized tool designed to cut out the parts that you don't need in your project. A minimal installation is only <b>431B</b>!</p>
		<p>For a guide on getting started with Umbra and Umbra Builder, see the sections below.</p>
		<hr/>

		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		<p>To get started with Umbra, download <a href='https://github.com/T3Lakuna/Umbra-Builder/releases/latest'>Umbra Builder</a> and walk through its prompts. An in-depth guide on how to use the Umbra Builder is located in the <a href='https://umbra-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>documentation</a> if you need it. Also in the documentation is a description of each tag, and an example project for after you've built your Umbra distribution.</p>
