Umbra Builder
=============
Umbra Builder is a tool that can be used to make custom distributions of Umbra, so that you don't have to waste a bunch of project size on useless features.

The newest version can always be downloaded from the Releases page on GitHub. (https://github.com/T3rrabyte/Umbra/releases/latest).
