TinyCanvas
==========
TinyCanvas is a minimal, lightweight rendering module developed by Felipe Alfonso.

It uses WebGL as a rendering backend for high performance. It does not fall back to canvas, to keep the library as small as possible.

The original code and documentation can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/bitnenfer/tiny-canvas).
