# WebGL 3D
In a normal WebGL program, the change from 2D to 3D is easy; all we need to do is convert our data to use 3D points (`vec3`) and 4D matrices (`mat4`). With Umbra, the change is even easier - just change the attribute constructor. Since Umbra already handles data in the form of `vec4` and `mat4`, there's no need for us to modify our shaders. Umbra will do all of the conversion for us.
```js
import { Attribute } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const positionAttribute = new Attribute("a_position", positionBuffer, 3);
```

The only change here from previous examples is that the `2` passed as the third argument to the `Attribute` constructor has been changed to a `3`. Note that 3 is actually the default value for this argument, so we could also just remove it entirely:
```js
import { Attribute } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const positionAttribute = new Attribute("a_position", positionBuffer);
```

Now that we're passing 3D values to WebGL, we can change our position buffer to match.
```js
import { Buffer } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const positionBuffer = new Buffer(gl, new Float32Array([
	x1, y1, z1,
	x2, y2, z2,
	x3, y3, z3,
	// Et cetera
]));
```

## Cube
In order to demonstrate a 3D program, we need a 3D object. Below are all of the values required to make a standard WebGL cube. Some of these we don't need for now, but I'm including them here for reference later.
```js
const cubeVertexPositions = [
	// Front
	-1, 1, 1,
	-1, -1, 1,
	1, -1, 1,
	1, 1, 1,

	// Back
	1, 1, -1,
	1, -1, -1,
	-1, -1, -1,
	-1, 1, -1,

	// Right
	1, 1, 1,
	1, -1, 1,
	1, -1, -1,
	1, 1, -1,

	// Left
	-1, 1, -1,
	-1, -1, -1,
	-1, -1, 1,
	-1, 1, 1,

	// Top
	-1, 1, -1,
	-1, 1, 1,
	1, 1, 1,
	1, 1, -1,

	// Bottom
	-1, -1, 1,
	-1, -1, -1,
	1, -1, -1,
	1, -1, 1
];

const cubeNormals = [
	// Front
	0, 0, 1,
	0, 0, 1,
	0, 0, 1,
	0, 0, 1,

	// Back
	0, 0, -1,
	0, 0, -1,
	0, 0, -1,
	0, 0, -1,

	// Right
	1, 0, 0,
	1, 0, 0,
	1, 0, 0,
	1, 0, 0,

	// Left
	-1, 0, 0,
	-1, 0, 0,
	-1, 0, 0,
	-1, 0, 0,

	// Top
	0, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 0,
	0, 1, 0,

	// Bottom
	0, -1, 0,
	0, -1, 0,
	0, -1, 0,
	0, -1, 0
];

const cubeTextureCoordinates = [
	// Front
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1,

	// Back
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1,

	// Right
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1,

	// Left
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1,

	// Top
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1,

	// Bottom
	0, 1,
	0, 0,
	1, 0,
	1, 1
];

const cubeIndices = [
	// Front
	0, 1, 2,
	0, 2, 3,

	// Back
	4, 5, 6,
	4, 6, 7,

	// Right
	8, 9, 10,
	8, 10, 11,

	// Left
	12, 13, 14,
	12, 14, 15,

	// Top
	16, 17, 18,
	16, 18, 19,

	// Bottom
	20, 21, 22,
	20, 22, 23
];
```

In Umbra, we can construct a `Geometry` using this data.
```js
import { Geometry } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const cube = new Geometry(cubeVertexPositions, cubeTextureCoordinates, cubeNormals, cubeIndices);
```

Then, we can create a `VAO` from the `Geometry`.
```js
import { VAO } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const vao = VAO.fromGeometry(program, cube, "a_position");
```

We could just supply the data directly to the VAO, but adding the extra step with `Geometry` is useful for later when we'll want to draw multiple objects of the same shape. You only need one `Geometry` for all cubes together, but you should have one `VAO` for each cube.

## Cube example

### Initialization step

#### Create the shaders
```glsl
#version 300 es

in vec4 a_position;
in vec4 a_normal;

uniform mat4 u_matrix;

out vec4 v_color;

void main() {
	gl_Position = u_matrix * a_position;

	v_color = a_normal * 0.5 + 0.5;
}
```

```js
const vertexShaderSource = `#version 300 es
in vec4 a_position;
in vec4 a_normal;
uniform mat4 u_matrix;
out vec4 v_color;
void main() {
	gl_Position = u_matrix * a_position;
	v_color = a_normal * 0.5 + 0.5;
}`;
```

Notice that we've added a buffer called `a_normal`. **The way we're using it here is not the primary way that normals are used**. This is simply the easiest way to get a different color for each side of the cube for this example.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision highp float;

in vec4 v_color;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	outColor = v_color;
}
```

```js
const fragmentShaderSource = `#version 300 es
precision highp float;
in vec4 v_color;
out vec4 outColor;
void main() {
	outColor = v_color;
}`;
```

#### Create the canvas
```js
import { makeFullscreenCanvas } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const canvas = makeFullscreenCanvas();
```

#### Get the context
```js
const gl = canvas.getContext("webgl2");
if (!gl) { throw new Error("WebGL2 is not supported by your browser."); }
```

#### Create the program
```js
import { Program } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const program = Program.fromSource(gl, vertexShaderSource, fragmentShaderSource);
```

#### Set the attributes
To set the attributes used in this program, we'll use the `Geometry` example described earlier.
```js
import { Geometry, VAO } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

// To avoid making this article excessively long, I will not be copying the cube data from above. It should go here.

const cube = new Geometry(cubeVertexPositions, cubeTextureCoordinates, cubeNormals, cubeIndices);
const vao = VAO.fromGeometry(program, cube, "a_position", null, "a_normal");
```

### Render step

#### Render loop
```js
const render = (time) => {
	requestAnimationFrame(render);

	// Render step.
}
requestAnimationFrame(render);
```

#### Resize the canvas
```js
import { resizeCanvas } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

resizeCanvas(canvas);
```

#### Set the viewport
```js
gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

#### 3D global state
There are a few options we should enable in order to draw 3D objects properly in WebGL. The first is `CULL_FACE`, which prevents WebGL from drawing any clockwise triangles. This is to stop WebGL from drawing triangles that are on the back of objects (which we can't see anyway), and serves to speed up the render step. **If you're going to use this feature, you must make sure that you properly declare your vertices in counter-clockwise order from the angle they will be viewed.**
```js
gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
```

Secondly, we want to enable the depth buffer (also called the "Z-Buffer") using `DEPTH_TEST`. This prevents triangles that are behind others from drawing over the ones in front.
```js
gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
```

#### Clear the canvas
Since we've enabled the depth buffer, we now need to also clear the `DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT` when clearing the screen.
```js
gl.clearColor(0, 0, 0, 0);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
```

#### Set a uniform
The final new step is to give our shape some perspective using `Matrix.perspective`. While it's possible to use `Matrix.orthographic`, it will make our shapes look weird and flat.
```js
import { Matrix } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

program.use();

program.uniforms.get("u_matrix").value = new Matrix()
	.perspective(45, canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight, 0.1, 5)
	.translate([0, 0, -3]) // Move the cube into the frustum of the camera.
	.rotate([time * 0.0004, time * 0.0007]);
```

#### Execute the program
```js
vao.draw();
```

### Result
[This](https://codepen.io/lakuna/full/OJgJeyq) is the above example.

## Cameras example
In the previous example, we moved the object in the scene in order to put it in the frustum of the camera. Usually, you'd want to instead move the camera. Umbra supplies a `Camera` class which performs the matrix math necessary for this operation.

This example is a modification of the previous one - all untouched code won't be mentioned.

### Initialization step

#### Create a camera
Instead of moving the cube `-3` on the Z axis, we'll move the camera `+3` on the Z axis.
```js
import { Camera } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

const camera = new Camera();
camera.translation.z += 3;
```

### Render step

#### Set a uniform
Instead of using `Matrix.translate` on the cube, we will instead start the matrix from the camera's `viewProjectionMatrix`.
```js
import { Matrix } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@lakuna/umbra.js";

program.use();

program.uniforms.get("u_matrix").value = camera.viewProjectionMatrix
	.rotate([time * 0.0004, time * 0.0007]);
```
