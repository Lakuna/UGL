# Umbra
Umbra is an engine/framework for creating HTML5-based games. It was created specifically for the [JS13KGames Game Jam](https://js13kgames.com), which limits total project size to 13kb.

# Documentation
The documentation can be found on [Read the Docs](https://umbra-framework.readthedocs.io/).

# Size
A minimal Umbra installation is 431b (~0.4kb), while a full installation is 3,293b (~3.2kb) (as of v1.0).

# Comparisons
## Ga
Umbra was preceeded by [Ga](https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga). All code in Umbra is original, but most feature ideas were taken directly from Ga.
That being said, Umbra boasts many advantages over Ga:

- Every feature that Ga has (minus drag-and-drop), and several more.
- Significantly faster.
- Can be built to match the user's needs, reducing file size.
- Even a full installation is less than half of the size of Ga without any plugins.
- Native support for audio.
- Object-oriented.
- Nice documententation.
- Has been updated within the last half decade.

## Kontra
Umbra is also comparable to the significantly more popular [Kontra.js](https://straker.github.io/kontra/).

- More features at a smaller size.
- Features that exist in Kontra and not Umbra are easy to implement in each project and don't belong in a framework.
