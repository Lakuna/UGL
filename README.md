# Umbra
Umbra is a lightweight JavaScript game framework, WebGL library, and math library. It includes a variety of functions which can be useful for developing two- and three-dimensional games, animations, or simulations. The math portion contains all of the basic linear algebra operations necessary to work with transformation matrices.

Umbra was originally intended to be used in the [JS13KGames](https://js13kgames.com/) game jam, which requires all submissions to be under 13 kilobytes (zipped).
