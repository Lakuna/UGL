After using Umbra Builder to build an Umbra distribution, it is recommended that you use an ECMAScript uglifier (such as [UglifyJS 3](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/)) to reduce the file size, then [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to compress the final program.

Umbra Builder tags are CASE SENSITIVE.

Note that package sizes are approximate. A full copy of Umbra is only 3,402b, although all of the packages add up to 3,603b (as of version 1.0).
