Ga reference: https://github.com/kittykatattack/ga/blob/master/ga.js

Complete sections marked with "// TODO".

Move to:
Object.defineProperties(this, {
	thing: {
		get: () => {
		}
		set: () => {
		}
	}
});

Look at plugins.js to see what you want to implement
- progress bar?
- particles?

Look through other frameworks for features that should be implemented.

After finishing the code:
1) Go through all the ga.js code again to make sure you didn't miss anything on accident.
2) Go through all the umbra.js code to make sure there isn't anything dumb in it.
3) Go through Ga bug reports to see if there's anything that can be improved.
4) Write documentation.
5) Umbra Builder.

Umbra Builder:
- Include only necessary parts of the code from a UI.
- Mark code with "// UMBRATAGSTART/UMBRATAGEND/UMBRATAG <TAG>" to help write a builder with only one source file.
- Multiple tags should be treated as ANDs.
- Mark code with "// UMBRATAGDESC <Description>" to add descriptions to tags, to be displayed in Umbra Builder. Probably put at the top.
- Mark code with "// UMBRATAGREQ <TAG> <TAG>" to make the former tag require the inclusion of the latter. Probably put at the top.
- Make tag "REQUIRED" non-optional.
- Get newest umbra.js from online with builder, so it can be a one-file program.
- Show un-uglified byte count (WITHOUT COMMENTS) for each tag.
- Probably write in Java Swing.
- Automatically uglify when done.
