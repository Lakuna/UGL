TODO notes:
- Follow best practices: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/WebGL_best_practices.
- Add missing features from old `Program` (i.e. `getActiveAttrib`, `getActiveUniform`) and new features (i.e. `getAttachedShaders`).
- Update write framebuffer, draw buffers (`drawBuffers`) in VAO draw method.
- Set the read buffer (`gl.readBuffer`) before calls to `copyTex[Sub]Image[23]D` and `readPixels`. Make `Context.readBuffer` internal.
- Get rid of `FramebufferAttachment` somehow.
- Ensure that `Context.throwIfError` is used everywhere that an error occurs. Ensure that `@throws` annotations are used in the documentation of these functions.
- Are the read buffer and draw buffers part of the context of the bound framebuffer? Conflicting information from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/drawBuffers and other sources.
